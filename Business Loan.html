	<h1>Business Loan</h1>
<br><br>
<h3>A business loan is a loan specifically intended for business purposes. As with all loans, it involves the creation of a debt, which will be repaid with added interest.</h3>
<p>A bank loan may be obtained from a bank and may be either secured or unsecured. For secured loans, banks will require collateral, which may be lost if repayments are not made. The bank will probably wish to see the business’s accounts, balance sheet and business plan, as well as studying the principals' credit histories. Many smaller businesses are now however turning towards Alternative Finance Providers, especially in the case of smaller firms.

Loans from credit unions may be referred to as bank loans as well. Business loans from credit unions received the second highest level of satisfaction from borrowers after loans from small banks</p>

<p>Business Loan interest rate starts from 11.90% onwards per annum. However, other factors too influence the final
		commercial business loan interest rates decided by the lender that include applicant’s profile and
		creditworthiness, business plan, credit score, required loan amount, repayment tenure, business vintage and
		profit, with various other financial aspects.</p>
		<h2>Factors Affecting Business Loan Interest Rates:</h2>
	The factors that affect business loan interest rates are as follows:
	<dl>
		<dt><b>1. Nature of Business:</b></dt>
		<dd>
			<p>
				The lender usually classifies the loan under Priority Sector and Non-Priority Sector. Loans that fall
				under
				Non-Priority Sector have a higher rate of interest, as compared to the priority sector loans. Hence, the
				nature of your business too determines the interest rate on your business loan.
			</p>
		</dd>
		<dt><b>2. Business Existence:</b></dt>
		<dd>
			<p>
				The longer your business is in existence, the better it is for you. However, irrespective of the nature
				of
				the business, the minimum business operation of 2 years is mandatory. With more number of years in
				business,
				you have a higher possibility of getting loan(s) at lower interest rates.
			</p>
		</dd>
		<dt><b>3. Monthly Turnover:</b></dt>
		<dd>
			<p>
				The longer your business is in existence, the better it is for you. However, irrespective of the nature
				of
				the business, the minimum business operation of 2 years is mandatory. With more number of years in
				business,
				you have a higher possibility of getting loan(s) at lower interest rates.
			</p>
		</dd>
		<dt><b>4. Credit Score:</b></dt>
		<dd>
			<p>
				Credit score evaluates your creditworthiness and is based on your credit history. In case you have
				availed a
				loan in the past and repaid it on time or if you pay credit card bills on time, you will have a good
				credit
				score. And, if you have a good credit score, it will work in your favor while applying for a loan. A
				good
				credit score will give you more benefits like lower interest rates and flexible tenure or repayment
				terms.
			</p>
		</dd>
		<dt><b>5. Collateral:</b></dt>
		<dd>
			<p>
				Collateral is the security, which is pledged to the lender to avail a loan. Higher the value of
				collateral,
				the more will be the benefits. Highly valuable collateral like real estate, equipment, machinery,
				deposits
				or home equity gives security to the bank. After examining the collateral, the bank may grant you a
				higher
				loan amount as the risk is low.
			</p>
		</dd>
		<dt><b>6. Type of Lender:</b></dt>
		<dd>
			<p>
				Business loan interest rates vary from one lender to another. But if you compare business loan interest
				rates offered by banks and NBFCs, you will find that banks levy lower interest rates, as compared to
				NBFCs.
			</p>
		</dd>
	</dl>
	<h2>How to apply for Business Loan</h2>
	<p>To avail business loan at low interest rate, applicant should consider below mentioned suggestions and
		techniques:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Prepare a Business Plan.</li>
		<li>Maintain financial stability along with good loan repayment history.</li>
		<li>Improve CIBIL score up to 700 or above.</li>
		<li>Improve your creditworthiness.</li>
		<li>Should have decent source of income.</li>
		<li>Apply for long-term business loan, instead of short-term.</li>
		<li>Build relationship with bank, open account.</li>
		<li>Do not close old accounts or credit cards.</li>
		<li>Increase your company’s profitability.</li>
		<li>Submit all the required documents – authentic and audited by CA.</li>
		<li>Apply loan with top private or public sector banks.</li>
		<li>Offer or submit valuable collateral or security, if required for secured business loan.</li>
	</ul>
	<h2>Types of Business Loan Interest Rates:</h2>
	<dl>
		<dt><b>1. Reducing or Diminishing Balance Rate</b></dt>
		<dd>
			<p>
				Reducing or diminishing balance rate is calculated each month on the remaining loan amount. If you opt
				for
				this type, the EMI comprises of interest that is payable for outstanding loan amount for each month
				along
				with the principal repayment. The good part is that after each EMI payment, the outstanding amount of
				the
				loan is reduced. Hence, the interest rate for the subsequent month would be the calculation of interest
				applicable only on the outstanding amount.
			</p>
		</dd>
		<dt><b>2. Fixed Rate of Interest</b></dt>
		<dd>
			<p>
				Fixed/flat interest rate is calculated on full loan amount during the course of its tenure. The interest
				is charged without considering the fact that the monthly EMIs would decrease that principal amount, and
				hence the interest rate.
			</p>
