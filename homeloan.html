    <h2>Types of Interest Rates in Home Loan:</h2>
    <p>There are mainly two types of home loan interest rates charged by most of the banks.</p>
    <b>1. Fixed Interest Rate:</b>
    <p>In this system of computation, the rate remains even throughout the loan tenor. There will be no change in the
        interest charges since the rate remains fixed. Depending on the offer, you may be allowed to switch over to the
        floating rate system after completing a certain duration into the loan tenure.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <b>Advantage:</b> The most visible perk of opting for the floating rate is that you have the advantage of
            being
            billed on the basis of the latest rate. If the rates fall, you save on interest charges.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Disadvantage:</b> In rare scenario, if the standard rates go up, the loan has to be bear the brunt of
            being
            billed a higher rate.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p><b>Note:</b> But, the floating home loan interest rates are cheaper than the fixed home loan interest rates on
        the first
        front.
