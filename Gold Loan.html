<h1>Gold Loan</h1>
<br>
<br>
<h3>What is a Gold Loan?</h3>
<p>Gold loan (also called loan against gold) is a secured loan taken by the borrower from a lender by pledging their gold articles (within a range of 18-24 carats) as collateral. The loan amount provided is a certain percentage of the gold, typically upto 80%, based on the current market value and quality of gold.</p>

<br>
<br>
<h3>What are the benefits of going for a gold loan?</h3>
<p>Gold loan is similar to personal loan in meeting your immediate financial requirements, be it an international education, marriage expenses, covering medical emergencies or any other personal use.
<ul><li>
Quick Disbursal- Minimum documentation leads to faster processing of gold loan due to its secured nature.</li><br>
<li>Flexibility of Use- Since there is no monitoring of the end use, it gives you the flexibility to use the loan for any type of expense.</li><br>
<li>Secured Loan Type: You are not required to submit any other security/collateral to the lender other than the pledged gold ornaments.</li><br>
<li>Lower Interest Rate: Interest rates on gold loans are on the lower side when compared to personal loan, since gold serves as collateral.</li><br>
<li>Liquidate your idle asset: An idle asset, gold is seldom used for generating money. Hence gold loan is the perfect solution to raise capital and use the fund when you require money to meet your financial needs. It is also more secure in the confines of a bank’s or a financial institution’s locker than your home.</li><br></p>

	<h2>Steps To Apply:</h2>
	<p>
		<b>Step 1:</b> You may be able to apply for a gold loan through online or offline channels. To apply online, you
		will
		need to visit the lender’s website and click on the loan product that you wish to apply for, which in this case
		would be ‘Gold Loan’. Next, you will need to click on ‘Apply Now’, if this option is available on the website.
		Post this, you will have to enter the required details into the online application form and submit the form
		online.
	</p>
	<p>
		<b>Step 2:</b> If there is no option to apply for the loan through the lender’s website, you will need to visit
		the
		nearest branch of the lender. Many lenders give customers the option of locating the nearest branch through
		their official website. Make sure to carry a copy of the required documents with you.
	</p>
	<p>
		<b>Step 3:</b> Once you submit the application form, the lender will verify your application. If the application
		gets
		approved, you will receive the loan amount.
	</p>
	<p>
		<b>Step 4:</b> A gold loan is a quick and easy way to get funds in the event of a financial emergency. Ensure
		that you
		do the required research and avail a gold loan that is suitable for your requirements and repayment capacity.
	</p>
	<h2>Required Documents:</h2>
	Generally, the following documents have to be provided by the borrower in order to avail the gold loan:
	<ul>
		<li>Duly-filled application form</li>
		<li>Passport sized photographs</li>
		<li>Identity proof</li>
		<li>Address Proof</li>
		<li>Signature Proof</li>
		<li>Form 60 or PAN card</li>
		<li>Proof of age</li>
		<li>Post-loan disbursement documents, if any.</li>
	</ul>
	<h2>Things To Consider While Taking A Gold Loan</h2>
	Listed below are a few things that you should take into consideration before applying for a gold loan in order to
	ensure that you have a good borrowing experience:
	<ul>
		<li>
			<b>Loan Amount:</b> When you avail a gold loan, the loan amount that you receive will be based on the value
			of the
			gold that you pledge. Lenders may have also specified a minimum and maximum loan amount. Thus, if you need
			to avail a particular loan amount, you should make sure that you have the required gold and ensure that it
			falls within the limits specified by the lender.
		</li>
		<br>
		<li>
			<b>Rate of Interest:</b> When compared to an unsecured loan, the interest rate charged for a gold loan is
			lesser
			since the borrower will have to provide collateral. That said, the interest rate charged will vary from
			lender to lender, and it is in your best interest to compare the interest rates charged by different
			lenders.
		</li>
		<br>
		<li>
			<b>Applicable Charges:</b> In addition to the interest rate, lenders may levy a number of other charges such
			as the
			processing fee, documentation fee, appraiser fee, payment default fee, loan overdue fee, etc. These charges,
			cumulatively, can increase the total cost of the loan. Thus, ensure that you take the charges levied by the
			lender into account before applying for a gold loan.
		</li>
		<br>
		<li>
			<b>Tenure of the Loan:</b> The repayment tenure for gold loans can range between 3 months and 36 months.
			Therefore,
			you should make sure to take your repayment ability into consideration and opt for a gold loan with a
			suitable loan tenure.
		</li>
		<br>
		<li>
			<b>Credibility of the Lender:</b> There are a number of banks and financial institutions that offer gold
			loans as
			part of their product portfolio. Before submitting an application to a particular lender, make sure that you
			check how credible the lender is. You should, thus, check the safety measures that are undertaken by the
			lender to keep your assets safe, online reviews, customer services channels offered, etc.
		</li>
		<br>
		<li>
			<b>Repayment Schedule:</b> The repayment schedule for gold loans is quite flexible. Based on the lender that
			you
			choose, you may be able to make repayments in the form of EMIs, pay the principal and the interest at the
			end of the policy term, or pay the interest on a monthly basis and pay the principal at the completion of
			the policy term. Hence, you should consider which repayment structure suits you best and choose the lender
			accordingly.
		</li>
		<br>
		<li>
			<b>Comparison of Loans:</b> It is highly recommended that you compare the features, benefits, and terms and
			conditions of the gold loans offered by different lenders before applying for a loan.
		</li>
		<br>
		<li>
			<b>Eligibility Criteria:</b> To increase the chances of your loan application getting approved, you should check
			the lender’s eligibility criteria before applying for the loan.
		</li>
	</ul>
